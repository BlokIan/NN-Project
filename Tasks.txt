Create function for visualizing image (numbers to image)
Look if format is correct
Split data
Baseline model and check if model overfits (it should in this case)
Preprocessing functions for regularization
Internal regularization techniques
Postprocessing regularization techniques / labels

For Preprocessing:
- Using methods such as t-SNE, MDS to give see the separability of the classes
- Distribution of training set images with classes, how training/testing data there is for each digit
- Visualize the digits

For Visualizing Performance:
- Plot curve for training and validation
- Confusion Matrix for the Validation set
